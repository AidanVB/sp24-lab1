## Activity: Editing and merging via a branch and a pull request

Open up the person.py file in the code editor in the GitHub browser. (Don't make a fork! Work in this repository.)

Edit the file by:

1. Adding a new attribute (it can be anything you want) to the person class.
2. Creating a new person object, p2, that represents you (i.e., your name and age).

Once you've made these changes, click "Commit changes..." and select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request." Follow the directions to commit your changes.

What happens next? 

If you are able to merge your changes, go ahead and do so.

If you are _not_ able to merge your changes... why is this happening? What might you do to be able to manage any merge conflicts that arise?

_Write your notes about what happened below (along with your name), by editing this README.md file._
