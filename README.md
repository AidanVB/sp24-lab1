## Activity: Editing and merging via a branch and a pull request

_Note: For this activity, don't make a fork. Work directly in this repository._

Open up the person.py file in the code editor in the GitHub browser (click on the file name, then the pencil icon). 

Edit the file by:

1. Read through the code and ask yourself: What does this code do? What will the outputs be?
2. Creating a new pie object, p2, that contains a different kind of pie.

Once you've made these changes, click **"Commit changes..."** and select **"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."** Follow the directions to commit your changes.

What happens next? 

- If you are able to merge your changes, go ahead and do so.

- If you are _not_ able to merge your changes... why is this happening? What might you do to be able to manage any merge conflicts that arise?

_Write your notes about what happened below (along with your name), by editing this README.md file._
